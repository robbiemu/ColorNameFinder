# About the coolors data found here

This data was sourced from [coolors.co](https://colors.co). 

[Per the FAQ](https://help.coolors.co/hc/en-us/articles/360010649799-Do-I-need-special-permissions-to-use-your-colors-):

- Our colors and their combination are not protected by any kind of copyright or intellectual property. You can, therefore, use them freely without any permission or any reference to Coolors

However, I always like to share and share alike. When opening the main page, these colors were made available from the compiled script.min.js. They are freely accessible from the console on the `Yu` variable without any need to interfere with the typical operation of the page.

## Caveat emptor

These color names are published by _coolors.co_ without indication of source. Only the properety name on the Yu variable (such as _hks_ or _pantone_) gives any indication of source. This indication is not interpretable as a guarantee of accuracy, completeness,  or actual source.
